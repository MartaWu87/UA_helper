# UA_helper
The project aims to coordinate support for refugees from Ukraine (I am strongly committed to helping Ukrainians) Currently, if you want assistance to refugees, it is best to be on track groups on Facebook or follow people involved in helping / volunteering. 2. The project contain a database of facilities in which refugees live. The database contain the following fields:

the name of the institution;
institution adress,Telephone, e-mail;
description of the institution (number of people in the institution + information on the number of children in the facility);
account number for payments; Institutions can create and update a list of needs. The list of needs will obligatorily include:
the date of adding the need (tIn my free time, I want to expand it with automatic closing of the need after 3 days);
description of the need;
category of aid (food, cosmetics, chemicals, material aid, personal hygiene products).
